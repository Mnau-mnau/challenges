        			         <p>
					           Rogue One was quite awesome, and quite different from the movies that came before. It was frightening, tense, very dark, VERY dirty (literally: maybe Mon Mothma was the only character without a layer of filth make-upped onto her face. And she looked so much like Mothma from ROTJ!) Some differences were somewhat striking, but overall it absolutely felt like a Star Wars movie should feel. Lots of familiar faces to see, super tense and exciting and beautiful. I was SO fortunate to be able to attend the premiere at the Pantages Saturday night, and can't wait to see it again Thursday night! There's never been a better time to be a Star Wars fan!

					       <h4> I feel like the void left in my heart by episode VII has been filled now.</h4>
        			         <p>
					       Maybe it's because I had higher expectations for episode VII and almost none for this one, I feel like this movie managed to achieve what the other one couldn't.<br>
					       I'm not saying that it was perfect, but it sure was good enough for me, and it will be good enough for many other die-hard SW fans. Leading female actor wasn't that good in my opinion, but otherwise this movie had everything a SW fan could wish for. Good old characters, good old places, and an overall good old SW feeling. Fits into the story line quite well, CGI was a bold move , could've gone bad, but it played out quite nicely. <br>
        					Overall I think SW fans will love it, but anybody not deeply immersed in the saga

                            <h4> Whoever didn't love episode 7 for any reason. This is your movie.</h4>
                            <p>
                            What a ride. This review will be filled with hyperbole, but I won't apologize. <br>
                            I saw and enjoyed Star Wars: Episode 7 a lot. It wasn't perfect, but it was good, and got me back into Star Wars mode again. Rogue One, however, surprised me in probably being the best Star Wars movie produced in this millennia, and I'm being serious. <br>
                            First of all, manage your expectations. Rogue One isn't a new type of cinema experience, or unique. It's also a prequel, so the story has somewhere specific it has to end up. <br>
                            With that in mind, Gareth Edward's movie is pretty close to an instant classic, in my opinion. It doesn't rush along, but give us ample time to get some sense of characters and locations. It doesn't dwell on exposition, other through character, and    actual plot. <br>
                            This is the story about how the rebel alliance acquired the plans for the death star, and it manages to give the plot and characters in A New Hope more meaning, and gravitas. <br>
                            It's hard to tell why it's so good without spoiling a story that was such a delight to experience unspoiled, so I'll sum it up really, really short: 
                            The only negative things I have to say about Rogue One, is that two CGI characters were 99% perfect instead of 100%. That's actually the reason I withhold my last star out of 10. It'll make sense after you've seen the movie. Other than that, this is everything I hoped for, and then some.
